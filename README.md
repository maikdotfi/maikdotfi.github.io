# Personal website

This is my personal website to host things, it's just a static page and it is written from scratch with basic HTML/CSS.

Currently hosted in GitHub pages, and probably will remain like that because more dynamic apps/sites would probably have a subdomain and actual server to run in.

## Principles

The website is built from scratch using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks, no dependencies.
