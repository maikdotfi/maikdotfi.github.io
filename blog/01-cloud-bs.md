# The Cloud is Bullshit

I have been working in a greenfield project at a client in a completely new context for me. As usual, I have been doing some IaC and whatnot to deploy our stuff into the _Cloud_ as usual.

While setting the infrastructure up I (again) realised how much effort I spent on things that have absolutely 0 value to the organisation, to the business. It's just bullshit. Why am I spending all this time fiddling with the IaC, struggling with the API, the shit documentation etc.

I guess the cloud started with just VMs (Elastic Compute) and some simple services on the side that you can run without worrying about **hardware**, but it sure as fuck has stayed that way too. By now I would have hoped that all this infrastructure BS would be handled for me, I would be able to focus on shipping the software instead of fiddling with all the knobs of the infrastructure endlessly.

In the olden days we would setup a server, install a LAMP stack of whatever and get the software up and running. If we were really advanced we would setup some Jenkins pipelines to package and deploy stuff. The Jenkins could have been running on an old company laptop at a colleagues desk (if this sounds bit too detailed, that's because it's a true story).

Of course fiddling the knobs of cloud infrastructure has kept food on the table for quite some years, but it's still bullshit.
