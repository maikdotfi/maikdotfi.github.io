      <p>I have been working in a greenfield project at a client in a completely new context for me. As usual, I have been doing some IaC and whatnot to deploy our stuff into the <em>Cloud</em> as usual.</p>
      <p>While setting the infrastructure up I (again) realised how much effort I spent on things that have absolutely 0 value to the organisation, to the business. It's just bullshit. Why am I spending all this time fiddling with the IaC, struggling with the API, the shit documentation etc.</p>
      <p>I guess the cloud started with just VMs (Elastic Compute) and some simple services on the side that you can run without worrying about <strong>hardware</strong>, but it sure as fuck has stayed that way too. By now I would have hoped that all this infrastructure BS would be handled for me, I would be able to focus on shipping the software instead of fiddling with all the knobs of the infrastructure endlessly.</p>
      <p>In the olden days we would setup a server, install a LAMP stack of whatever and get the software up and running. If we were really advanced we would setup some Jenkins pipelines to package and deploy stuff. The Jenkins could have been running on an old company laptop at a colleagues desk (if this sounds bit too detailed, that's because it's a true story).</p>
      <p>The real difference here is that the activities from the olden days are what I would consider the <em>essential</em> complexity of the task, but in the Cloud I feel too much time is spent on managing <em>accidental</em> complexity. Of course the shape of the software architecture is often also different in these Cloud deployments and it enables <strong>some</strong> teams to solve genuine scaling challenges, but adds accidental complexity to most. Good example is that teams <em>must</em> deploy to a Kubernetes service in the Cloud, while they could be just using a higher level abstraction happily (and migrate to another if that is truly needed one day).</p>
      <p>Of course fiddling the knobs of cloud infrastructure has kept food on the table for quite some years, but it's still bullshit.</p>
